Pong is a game where you and another player control a paddle (long rectangle) to hit a puck (square) towards the other player. If the opponent fails to return the puck, you score a point.
The physics of this game are pretty simple; if you return the puck and the puck is towards the edge of the paddle (as opposed to the center of it), it will return at an angle.
